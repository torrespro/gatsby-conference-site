Hypatia made significant contributions to the study of quadratic equations, which are equations of the form ax^2 + bx + c = 0, where a, b, and c are constants, and x is the variable. She developed a method for solving quadratic equations by completing the square, which is still taught today.

Hypatia's method of completing the square was a significant breakthrough in the study of quadratic equations. It was a more systematic and general method than the ad hoc methods used by previous mathematicians, and it allowed for the solution of more complex quadratic equations.

Hypatia's work on quadratic equations was not limited to theoretical developments. She also used her knowledge of quadratic equations to solve practical problems, such as determining the dimensions of a rectangular field given its area and the length of its diagonal.

Her method of completing the square is still used today, and her work on the properties of quadratic equations laid the foundation for further developments in algebra and mathematics.
