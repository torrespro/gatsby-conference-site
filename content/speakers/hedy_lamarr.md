Lamarr was self-taught, tinkered in her spare time on various hobbies and ideas, which included a traffic stoplight and a tablet that would dissolve in water to create a carbonated drink.  
The beverage was unsuccessful; Lamarr herself said it tasted like Alka-Seltzer. 

In 1997, Lamarr was honored with the Electronic Frontier Foundation's Pioneer Award and Lamarr also was the first woman to receive the Invention Convention's BULBIE Gnass Spirit of Achievement Award. 
The following year, Lamarr's native Austria awarded her the Viktor Kaplan Medal of the Austrian Association of Patent Holders and Inventors.

As actress, Hedy Lamarr was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.

In 1939, Lamarr was also selected the "most promising new actress" of 1938 in a poll of area voters conducted by Philadelphia Record film critic.  
British moviegoers voted Hedy Lamarr the year's 10th best actress, for her performance in Samson and Delilah in 1951.
